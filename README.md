# leaflet-challenge

As it often does, XPert Learning Assist helped me find mistakes in my code when I was running into errors.

I was struggling with getting the legend to add correctly for a while, but then I realized that I was saying legend.addTo(map) instead of legend.addTo(myMap). I had also neglected to add the legend div to the index.html starter file, so of course nothing was showing up.

I also used xPert Learning Assist to help me with the spacing of the legend as initially my color squares were not aligned. Once I created a div for each legend item, this issue was fixed.

I had completed the majority of Part 1 of this assignment (apart from fixing my legend) prior to Project 3, however, once the project started, I prioritized that and my group instead. After reading the instructions more carefully, I realize that Part 2 is optional. To make sure I'm ready for week 18, I'm going to hold off on completing Part 2 at this time, but plan to go back to it as time allows. Thank you for your patience with this late submission.
